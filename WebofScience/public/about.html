                <h3>Citation Metrics</h3>
                <p class="pabout">
                   These citation metrics are pulled directly from Google Scholar using SerpAPI.
                   <br>
                   While we only show a brief snippet of them, you can see the total number of citations displayed, and obviously getting them all would be much more of a challenge!
                   <br>
                   You can check them out <a href="https://serpapi.com/">here</a>.

                <h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
                <p class="pabout">
                    Sentiment Analysis is used here to identify and label articles and documents based off of certain word meanings. 
                    <br>
                    We label articles as objective, subjective or neutral based off of these specific words and give them different weightings. For example: 
                    <br> 
                    "In my opinion" is more subjective, while "Research shows" is more objective. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally we also label articles either positive, negative or neutral polarity of how it looks at its subject. 
                    <br>
                    This is done exactly the same as above, just different weightings of words.
