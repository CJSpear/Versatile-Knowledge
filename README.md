# Versatile-Knowledge
My INFO301 Project for Otago University. 
The Zip File can be used to create the project quickly
Made with my INFO 301 Team - Ryan, Sarah, Sayyed & Billy

This project is a webpage, in which someone could upload files (to a database) and get a sentiment analysis of said file.
This would then be stored on the database and be displayed on the webpage with it's score
